1. Make player object a member of app_loop and add functionality for a persistant player object between scenes. a lot of this is already done, but it is incomplete and full of bugs that need to be fixed
2. Define player's physics body as two rectangles, one for the head, one for the body. This will improve collision acuracy.


-- other ideas
+ have two files, one "enemy_manager" and one "enemy_factory", where the enemy manager will contain and manage all the emeies and the enemy factory has functions to create new enemies from a list of types
+ add pause/resume scene functionality. this is probably fairly difficult to implement, but should enable the ability to pause a scene, 
	go to another one, then come back to this first one and resume it from where it left off.
+ add z-index functionality. This could be done with having different display groups for each z-index level then just add them to the main display group in order.
